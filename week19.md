### Personal Assignments
1. [Capstone Proposal](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/capstone-central/blob/master/02_initial-proposal.md) - There is a link to a google form at the top of that page.  It needs to be filled out to get your topic approved.  Please direct message ZOE when you are ready for it to be looked at.  She will review the proposal and reach out with any questions.
2. [Final Personal Site](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/personal-bio-site-instructions/blob/master/personal-bio-site-05.md).  We will be checking your personal sites during the first week back from break.  You should have three real projects on the page.  All should have links to deployed demos.  You will not be able to start your capstone until your personal site is finished
