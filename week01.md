# HW Week 1

1. Add your photo to slack and github.   Of your face - NOT your cat, dog, dinosaur, or BFF.  Your real face...semi recently.
2. Complete this form about Studygroups: [Studygroup Preference](https://goo.gl/forms/NrOM5scsjipUE6CG3)
3. [Treehouse Prework](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/prework) - you should be done with this already but in case you aren't get the treehouse done ASAP.  I'm talking about steps 1, 2, 4, and 5.
4. [Book Prework](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/prework) - once your treehouse is completely done make sure you have done all the reading.I'm talking about steps 3 and 6.

Already done with your prework? Good work!  Take this opportunity to revisit parts of the book or treehouse that you felt uncomfortable with.  If you have done that go on to the Beyond the Basics
