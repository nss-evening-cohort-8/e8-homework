# HW Week 2


1.  Have 25 repos pushed to github (first-one, second-one, test3-test25). DO NOT DO ALL 25 ON THE SAME DAY.  Maximum of 5 repos per day.  Each repo should have:
  * Each repo should start with a README.md file that you push to master branch 
  * Each repo should have a setup branch. This branch should have an index.html and main.css file. The index.html file should have html boilerplate and a link to the CSS file. The css file should change the background color. 
  * There should be PR from the setup branch to the master branch 
  * Before you merge the PR - your code should be properly indented and clean (consistent appropriate spacing) 
  * Final result for a repo should have everything merged into master
